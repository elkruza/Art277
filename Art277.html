<h1> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1> 
<p>
<strong> Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
<u>Loren Ipsum</u><br>
has been the industry's standard dummy text eversince the 1500s, when an unknown printer <br> took 
a gallery of type and scrambled 
it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not <br> only five centuries , but also the leap into 
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially<br>
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the releaase of Letraset sheets containing <br> Lorem 
Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
publishing
software like <em><strong><u> aldus <br> page maker </u></strong></em> including versions of Lorem 
Ipsum. 1914 translation by H. Rackham <br>
<!--this is where i indent a the paragraph--> 
<blockquote> Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet, consecteur adipiscing elit, sed do esiusmod tempor <br> 
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna alique. Ut enim ad minim 
veniam, quis nostrud <br> exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea comodo consequat. Duis aute 
<br> irure dolor in reprehenderit voluptate velit esse 
cilum dolore eu gugiat nulla <br> pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa 
qui offica <br> deserunt mollit anim 
id est laborum. <br> </blockquote>

<h1> Why do we use it?</h1> <!-- i used header one instead of header to so that both header can be the 
same size --> <br>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page<br> when 
looking at its layout. The point of
 using <u> Loren Ipsum </u> is that it has a more-or-less <br> normal distribution of Letters, as opposed 
to using <q>Content here, content here</q>, making it <br> 
look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now <br> use Lorem 
Ipsum as their default model text, 
and a search for <q> Lorem Ipsum</q> will undercover <br> many web psites still in their infancy. 
Various versions have evolved over the years, <br> some times
by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

<h1> Where can I get some?</h1> <!-- this is the third header-->
<b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority <br> have suffered 
alteration in some form, by 
injected humour, <u>radomized words</u><br> which don't look even slightly believable.</b> If you are 
going to use a passage of Lorem <br> Ipsum
you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the midle of the text. <br> <em> All the 
Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat 
predefined chunks as <br> necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</em> It uses 
a dictionary of over <br> 200 Latin words, which combined with 
a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Loren <br> Ipsum which looks reasonable. The 
generator Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from <br> repetition,
injustice humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
