   <h1>Travelling in Depression </h1>
   
   <!-----this is the first paragraph, i used line breaks or the p elements to create extra space between the lines----->

      When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in <br>France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.</p>

<p> At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco <br>feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, <br>megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old <br>
stones were still in place.</p>
 
 
 <!------i used line break <br> to create space between paragraphs, instead of using the <p> element------>


 <p> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.<br><br>

<p> accentan with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I <br>
remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. <br>
But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more <br>
accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>


<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its <br>
similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is <br>
béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible <br>to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find <br>
that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in <br>
Spanish.</p>


<br>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied <br>Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a <br>
character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by <br>
combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning<br> mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love <br>spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them. <br>
